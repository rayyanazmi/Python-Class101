# Type() function is used to find the data type of a given variable in python

a = "31.7"
b = float(a) # a but the type should be float
t = type(a) #class <int>

print(t)

'''above we can try to find data type in various way
like -- "31.7" will be a string data type and if 31.7 is there w/o double quote it will be a floating point data type'''

# Conversion of data 

''' 
str(31) => "31"
int("33") => 33
float(32) => 32.0
