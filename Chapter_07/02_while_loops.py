# In while loops, the condition is checked first. If it evaluates to true, the body of the loop is executed otherwise not! If the loop is entered, the process of [condition check & execution] is continued until the condition becomes False.

i = 1

while(i<6):
    print(i)
    i +=1

#If the condition never become false, the loop keeps getting executed
