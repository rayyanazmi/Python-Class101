# Q.Use REPL and print the table of 5 using it

# REPL - Read, Evaluate, Print, Load
'''
In this problem we have used REPL by running terminal
where, I've written 'python' then pressed ENTER 
then just use any arthematic operator to see the function of REPL
where python is used as a CALCULATOR
ex- 
5+5=10
5*2=10
5*8=40

above is the example of using REPL (Read, Evaluate, Print, Load).
