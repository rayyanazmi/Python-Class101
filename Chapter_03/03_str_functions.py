#Some of the commonly used functions to perform operations on or manipulate strings are as follows. Let us assume there is a string ‘name’ as follows

name = "rayyan azmi"

print(len(name))
print(name.endswith("yan"))
print(name.startswith("ray"))
print(name.capitalize())

print(name.find("azmi"))
print(name.replace("a", "w"))
